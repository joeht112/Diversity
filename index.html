            <h4>Diversity</h4>
            <p> Diversity is important in the world of today because despite our collective history, we are all one people and the 21st century should be about uniting us all, the way it should have been all along.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h4>Inclusion</h4>
            <p>Inclusion means making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and/or become part of a community. We should be proud to take extra steps to ensure this kind of equity because it shows <em>compassion</em> and <em>co-operation</em> to each and every human being, no barriers no excuses.</p>

            <h4>The Real World</h4>
            <p>It's not a secret that we haven't always been the most supportive of other lifestyles throughout history, and it's undeniable that some groups still uphold these outdated ideal today. But exclusion based on an uncontrolable factor with no passable reason is wrong, and it is everyone's fight to protect the moral and just cause that is fighting racism, sexism, anti-semitism and ableism.</p>
